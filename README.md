# Java 2D engine

# About
I wanted to make this project for educational and enterntainment purpose so the engine is far from being professional </br>
And because of that I don't spend much time working on it </br>

# Features (so far)
Scene Management. </br>
Rendering images, solid colors and text on screen.</br>
Physics (Somewhat)</br>

# Todo:
Bug fixes <br/>
Try to make it work with OpenGL instead of JPanel<br/>
Optimize collisions <br/>
